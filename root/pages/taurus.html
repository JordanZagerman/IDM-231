			<h1 class="conspiracyHeader">New Coke</h1>
		<p>Coca-Cola halted production of its flagship beverage in 1985 and introduced New Coke in its place as a marketing ploy to combat declining market share and rekindle interest in the original drink.</p>
		<p>New Coke was designed to cover up the switch of sweeteners to high fructose corn syrup in Coke Classic. They knew people would notice if they just made the switch one day, so they came up with a clever way to get it off the market for a few months, thinking people would forget what it actually tasted like by the time it came back into circulation.</p>
		<p>It was also to cover up the removal of the last traces of coca (an ingredient also found in cocaine) that were still in the recipe to keep the DEA off their backs.</p>
