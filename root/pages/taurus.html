		<p>Mass internment facilities have been built across the continental United States by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in preparation for a future declaration of martial law.</p>
		<p>The camps come complete with barbed wire fences straight out of World War II, boxcars for moving people around, and plastic coffins for burying them.</p>
		<p>Additionally, a contingency plan (Rex 84) drafted in part by Oliver North calling for the suspension of the Constitution and the detainment of citizens in the event of a national crisis. Has been linked to a 1970 document by Louis Giuffrida (years later, the director of FEMA) calling for the establishment of martial law in the event of an uprising by African American militants and the internment of millions of African Americans.</p>
