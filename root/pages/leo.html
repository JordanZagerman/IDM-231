		<p>The Illumunati is an Order who make up part of The Cabal, comprised of mostly government officials and the "elite class". They operate within various Cabal Control Centers that are used to facilitate a New World Order. The Illuminati began as a secret society founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt. This was the same year the All-Seeing Eye was added to the Great Seal of the United States. An ex-Illuminati programmer named Svali says that they appear to be descendants of the Knights Templar and the Rosicrucians. </p>
		<p>In the present day, Illuminati members are mostly comprised of government officials and the "elite class". The Illuminati manages and manipulates parts of the political and financial spectrum of the Cabal's agenda, which is to facilitate a New World Order. The Illuminati, and even Freemasonry, from which it derives, receives much of the attention due to the various symbols and structural patterns that are often observed by the general public. The Illuminati is said to be made up of about 13 different families, each with its own primary agenda. These families include, but are not limited to Rothschild, Rockefeller, and Li.
