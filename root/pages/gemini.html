		<p>Commissioner David Stern and the NBA rigged the lottery so the New York Knicks would get the first pick and, with it, select Patrick Ewing.</p>
		<p>After a dominant college career at Georgetown, Ewing was the surefire first pick of the 1985 NBA draft. He was a "once in a decade" talent who would change the fate of whichever team picked him. The Knicks were desperate for a center, and the NBA was desperate for a good team in New York.</p>
		<p>Yes, an envelope placed in a freezer sent Patrick Ewing to the Knicks with the top pick. The benefits of such a scheme, were numerous — the most obvious being that seeing as how the NBA is a star-driven league, strategically placing stars in major media markets generates interest, which generates ratings, which generate revenue. The key is to follow the money.</p>
