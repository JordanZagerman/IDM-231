			<h1 class="conspiracyHeader">The Earth is Flat</h1>
		<p>Members of the Flat Earth Society know that the Earth is flat. Walking around on the planet's surface, it looks and feels flat, so they know all evidence to the contrary, such as satellite photos of Earth as a sphere, to be fabrications of a "round Earth conspiracy" orchestrated by NASA and other government agencies.</p>
		<p>The belief that the Earth is round has been described as the ultimate government hoax. Proven by the exhaustive effort flat-earthers have invested in fleshing out the theory on their website, as well as the staunch defenses of their views they offer in media interviews and on Twitter, it is safe to say the Earth is flat.</p>
		<p>Earth is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica, a 150-foot-tall wall of ice, around the rim. NASA employees, guard this ice wall to prevent people from climbing over and falling off the disc.</p>
		<p>Additionally, Earth's gravity is an illusion, they say. Objects do not accelerate downward; instead, the disc of Earth accelerates upward at 32 feet per second squared (9.8 meters per second squared), driven up by a mysterious force called dark energy.</p>
