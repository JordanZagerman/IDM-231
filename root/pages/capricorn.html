			<h1 class="conspiracyHeader">Jesus Had a Wife and Child</h1>
		<p> According to writings from the Gnostic Gospels, discovered in 1945. Jesus married Mary Magdalene, had one or more children, and those children or their descendants emigrated to what is now southern France. In the Gospel of Philip, Mary Magdalene, who is referred to as Jesus' koinonos, a Greek term for "companion" or "partner," is depicted as being closer to Jesus than any other apostle.</p>
		<p>In an exchange between Peter and Mary, he admits to her that "the Saviour loved you above all other women". A tense moment in the scripture that seems to portray the jealousy that the other apostles might have felt for Mary's relationship with Jesus. The only other evidence used to support the theory is a mention of Jesus kissing Mary often.</p>
