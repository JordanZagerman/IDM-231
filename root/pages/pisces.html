			<h1 class="conspiracyHeader">Denver International Airport</h1>
		<p>When Denver International Airport was built. There was already a fully functioning airport closer to downtown.</p>
		<p>The new airport is twice the size of Manhattan and went $2 billion over budget during construction.</p>
		<p>The $2 billion went into building the Illuminati's headquarters beneath the airport. To make a long story short. When the airport was first built, workers somehow screwed up the first five buildings. Instead of removing them, they were buried.</p>
		<p>Additionally, the airport's dedication: March 19, 1994. If added together — 1+9+1+9+9+4 — you get 33, the highest level one can achieve in Freemasonry.</p>
